As a member of the Institute for Spatial Data Science, her research focuses on applying advanced data science techniques to explore the spatial, temporal, and demographic determinants of health, with the goal of reducing inequalities. She is particularly interested in leveraging both open and commercial secondary data to understand behaviours and identify barriers faced by diverse population groups. Her work is strongly policy-oriented, collaborating with stakeholders to transform research informed insights into actionable strategies. Recent projects include the development of data-driven tools to assess food insecurity risk across the UK and initiatives aimed at enhancing the safety of women and girls in public parks. Fran’s research not only advances academic knowledge but also directly informs policies that aim to improve public health and social equity. # Education\n\n\nEducation\nPhD School of Geography, Data Analytics & Society CDT, University of Leeds (UoL)}: “Assessing Determinants of Physical Activity Using Secondary Smartphone Data”\n\n\nSection test\n\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\nf\ng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection test 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\nf\ng\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA generic callout\n\nd\ne\nf\ng\n\n\n\n\n&lt;button class=“dropdown-btn”&gt;Education&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;div class=“dropdown-content”&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, University X (2013–2017)&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;High School, School Y (2009–2013)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;"

Products such as confectionery can no longer be placed at store entrances, ends of aisles, or at the checkout in large retail stores and their online equivalents.\n\n\n\nOur protocol sets out how daily sales and product data from multiple retailers will be used to evaluate the legislation’s success in relation to HFSS sales, product portfolios and equitability. Food and drink sales data from 18 months pre- and 12 months post-introduction of the policy will be gained from multiple large UK retailers. Online sales are excluded.\nEligible stores were defined as supermarkets from our partner retailer brands with store areas larger than 280 square metres. From the eligible store sample, we selected 160 intervention stores (England) and 50 control stores (Scotland and Wales) from each partner retailer.\nThe sample provides equal store numbers across each decile of the Priority Places for Food Index (PPFI) from each retailer (n = 16), capturing food insecurity risk, and maximum coverage of store (store size) and store area characteristics (urban/rural status).\nControlled interrupted time-series will be used to estimate effects of the policy, with stores from Scotland and Wales (where the legislation has not been implemented) acting as controls.\n\n\n\nThis protocol sets out the first multiple-retailer independent analysis of the HFSS legislation, demonstrating how business digital footprints data can contribute to policy evaluation.\n\n\n\nOutcomes will include sales of HFSS products and changes to available product portfolios. We will explore whether legislation impacts were equitable across stores in areas with different demographic characteristics, according to the English Indices of Multiple Deprivation and the PPFI.\nFindings at the retailer and cross-retailer levels will inform sector-level insights regarding impact and potential next steps for policy and business practice.\n\n\n\nOur conclusions will contribute to policy-relevant discussions around the effectiveness of HFSS government policy, with potential to influence future decision-making across the UK Devolved Nations."
